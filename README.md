# Overview
This repository implements a microprocessor architecture simulation of barrier behavior.

# Getting Started
To learn more about the project, I've written some unit tests to help you get started.
If you're interested in diving deeper, you can also check out the detailed article (in Chinese) at https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/703597874.
If you're willing to help with translation, we can make it available to a broader audience!

# Build the Project
To build the project, simply pull the repository and run `make`. Make sure you have `g++` installed to compile the code.
Address any issues reported by the compiler to ensure a smooth build process.

# Run the Simulation
Execute the command `./barrier` and wait for all tests to passed successfully.
